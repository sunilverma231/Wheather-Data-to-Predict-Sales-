# "WeatherTrend Oz: Forecasting Weather Patterns for FMCG Sales Optimization in Australia"

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

An FMCG company P&J found that the sales of their best selling items are affected by the weather and rainfall trend. For example, the sale of tea increases when it rains, sunscreen is sold on the days when it is least likely to rain, and the sky is clear. They would like to check whether the weather patterns play a vital role in the sale of certain items. Hence as initial experimentation, they would like you to forecast the weather trend in the upcoming days. The target region for this activity is Australia; accordingly, this exercise will be based on analysing and cleaning the weather data from the Australian region available on public platforms.
